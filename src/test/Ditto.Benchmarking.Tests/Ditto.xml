            <summary>
            Very simple benchmarking framework. Looks for all types
            in the current assembly which have public static parameterless
            methods marked with the Benchmark attribute. In addition, if 
            there are public static Init, Reset and Check methods with
            appropriate parameters (a string array for Init, nothing for
            Reset or Check) these are called at appropriate times.

            <summary>
            Parses the command line, returning an array of strings
            which are the arguments the tasks should receive. This
            array will definitely be non-null, even if null is
            passed in originally.
