{''} is a small framework for mapping objects to objects (aka 'Object-Object Mapper').

Primary design goals in no particular order:
1. Convention-based asuumptions to minimize configuration as much as possible
2. Aggregation of source objects into their destinations
3. Deep validation checking
4. Garrulous by design
5. Fluent configuration without typedsturbating generic parameters
6. Fast enough
7. IoC, container-based
