## {''} is a small framework for mapping objects to objects (aka 'Object-Object Mapper') in dot net.

Primary design goals in no particular order:
1. Convention-based assumptions to minimize configuration as much as possible
2. Easily supports aggregation of source objects into destination
3. Deep validation checking
4. Garrulous
5. Fluent configuration without typedsturbating generic parameters
6. Fast enough
7. IoC, container-based
